Hi!

This is Haomin Lin, here I include my solution to the test project from NeuroFlow. This is a very interesting project, and I enjoyed it very much! Thank you for preparing it for me!

For Part 1, I created a iPython notebook file (Part_1/NeuroFlow_P1.ipynb) to include all my analysis and corresponding visualizations. I also uploaded a PDF print of the notebook for easier access.

For Part 2, I created a SQL file (Part_2/NeuroFlow_P2.sql) to include my solutions to the three questions in Part 2.

Thank you so much!

All the best,

Haomin
